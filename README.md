# React Chat App using Scaledrone

DEPLOYED TO: https://lykoskia.github.io/react-chat-app/

This project was assigned to my class as the final project for our [Front end developer qualification](https://www.algebra.hr/cjelozivotno-obrazovanje/programi/front-end-developer/).\
Originally developed in March-April 2023 while we were fresh out of our React course, I decided to redo this from scratch in September 2023; fixing a few bugs, adding a few features and polishing up the app in general.\
\
After finishing the course I went to work on another app (the barcode generator), released a demo in June, took a break (burnout + life) and came back in August to finish it.\
\
With the myriad things I learned while developing that app, I decided to go back to this project in September and rewrite it from scratch to get a feel for how much I've improved since first learning React basics.\
\
Most notably, I finally got prop passing through my head, so I divided the App into several components. I also added the ability to choose usernames (instead of assigning random ones like in the Scaledrone docs/tutorials) and display them correctly in the member list.
